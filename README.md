# IIUM-Visa-Renwal-Application-System

#### ***Project Objective:***
To develop a complete online visa application system for International students of International Islamic University Malaysia.

#### ***Project Description:***
International students have a lot of difficultiesÂ getting their visas renewed during this time. Since the office strictly forbids it, they are unable to physically submit papers. In order to fix the issue for the visa unit and overseas students, the office of International Affairs (IO) takes the initiative. Students can easily submit their documents online utilizing this system. It prevents conflicts between students and staff, saves time, and money. It was my part-time office project which developed by HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap with Google Scripts.
